# esp32-cdc-faker

## An ESP32 based fake CD changer for various car radios.
For now this is only an idea but will be my side project in 2017. This project will consist of a small piece of hardware and some software.

## Hardware
The hardware will be built around the ESP32 IC by Espressif. This neat little IC bundles Bluetooth and WiFi connectivity aswell as more than enough computing power and IOs for my purposes. The ESP32 will be accompanied by an i2c DAC for analogue audio output to the car radio. The integrated DACs of the ESP32 do not seem suitable for my purposes due to their low (8 bit) resolution and possibly slow sampling rate.
